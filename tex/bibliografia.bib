abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to build the foundation for software architecture. We first develop an intuition for software architecture by appealing to several well-established architectural disciplines. On the basis of this intuition, we present a model of software architecture that consists of three components: elements, form, and rationale. Elements are either processing, data, or connecting elements. Form is defined in terms of the properties of, and the relationships among, the elements --- that is, the constraints on the elements. The rationale provides the underlying basis for the architecture in terms of the system constraints, which most often derive from the system requirements. We discuss the components of the model in the context of both architectures and architectural styles and present an extended example to illustrate some important architecture and style considerations. We conclude by presenting some of the benefits of our approach to software architecture, summarizing our contributions, and relating our approach to other current work.},

abstract = {Context
Systematic mapping studies are used to structure a research area, while systematic reviews are focused on gathering and synthesizing evidence. The most recent guidelines for systematic mapping are from 2008. Since that time, many suggestions have been made of how to improve systematic literature reviews (SLRs). There is a need to evaluate how researchers conduct the process of systematic mapping and identify how the guidelines should be updated based on the lessons learned from the existing systematic maps and SLR guidelines.
Objective
To identify how the systematic mapping process is conducted (including search, study selection, analysis and presentation of data, etc.); to identify improvement potentials in conducting the systematic mapping process and updating the guidelines accordingly.
Method
We conducted a systematic mapping study of systematic maps, considering some practices of systematic review guidelines as well (in particular in relation to defining the search and to conduct a quality assessment).
Results
In a large number of studies multiple guidelines are used and combined, which leads to different ways in conducting mapping studies. The reason for combining guidelines was that they differed in the recommendations given.
Conclusion
The most frequently followed guidelines are not sufficient alone. Hence, there was a need to provide an update of how to conduct systematic mapping studies. New guidelines have been proposed consolidating existing findings.}

abstract = {Context
Software architecture design creates and documents the high-level structure of a software system. Such structure, expressed in architectural models, comprises software elements, relations among them, and properties of these elements and relations. Existing software architecture methods offer ways to derive architectural models from requirements specifications. These models must balance different forces that should be analyzed during this derivation process, such as those imposed by different application domains and quality attributes. Such balance is difficult to achieve, requiring skilled and experienced architects.
Object
The purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive overview of the existing methods to derive architectural models from requirements specifications and offer a research roadmap to challenge the community to address the identified limitations and open issues that require further investigation.
Method
To achieve this goal, we performed a systematic mapping study following the good practices from the Evidence-Based Software Engineering field.
Results
This study resulted in 39 primary studies selected for analysis and data extraction, from the 2575 initially retrieved.
Conclusion
The major findings indicate that current architectural derivation methods rely heavily on the architects’ tacit knowledge (experience and intuition), do not offer sufficient support for inexperienced architects, and lack explicit evaluation mechanisms. These and other findings are synthesized in a research roadmap which results would benefit researchers and practitioners.}

  abstract = {Uncertainty is present in software architecture decisions due to a lack of knowledge about the requirements and the solutions involved. However, this uncertainty is usually not made explicit, and decisions can be made based on unproven premises or false assumptions. This paper focuses on a technique called ArchHypo that uses hypotheses engineering to manage uncertainties related to software architecture. It&nbsp;proposes formulating a technical plan based on each hypothesis’ assessment, incorporating measures able to mitigate its impact and reduce uncertainty. To evaluate the proposed technique, this paper reports an application of the technique in a mission-critical project that faced several technical challenges. Conclusions were based on data extracted from the project documentation and a questionnaire answered by all team members. As a result, the application of ArchHypo provided a structured approach to dividing the architectural work through iterations, which facilitated architectural decision-making. However, further research is needed to fully understand its impact across different contexts. On the other hand, the team identified the learning curve and process adjustments required for ArchHypo's adoption as significant challenges that could hinder its widespread adoption. In&nbsp;conclusion, the evidence found in this study indicates that the technique has the potential to provide a suitable way to manage the uncertainties related to software architecture, facilitating the strategic postponement of decisions while addressing their potential impact.},

  abstract = {In the evolving landscape of software engineering, managing the uncertainties that impact architectural decisions is paramount for ensuring the resilience and adaptability of software systems. This paper focuses on documenting, as patterns, the foundational practices employed by a technique named ArchHypo, which uses hypothesis engineering to manage uncertainties in software architecture and enhance decision-making processes. By exploring three diverse projects that implement the ArchHypo technique, we delineate a set of patterns that systematically address the complexities of uncertainty. These patterns provide a more systematic structured framework for software architects and developers, enabling them to make uncertainties explicit and manageable, thus facilitating the identification of opportune moments for architectural commitments. The delineated patterns contribute to a structured and informed decision-making process and offer an approach to managing uncertainties tailored to agile development’s dynamic landscape.},

A technique called ArchHypo proposes an approach based on hypothesis engineering to manage this uncertainty related to the software architecture. As a part of it, for each hypothesis identified, a technical plan is elaborated with actions that aim to reduce the uncertainty or its impact. This paper focuses on patterns that can be used as part of this technical plan in cases where uncertainty is recurrent in several features or parts of the system. For example, there might be uncertainty about usability or performance that can affect several features. The patterns documented in this paper propose small adjustments in the development process, like adding constraints to existing tasks or introducing steps before or after certain activities, to deal with these uncertainties.},
