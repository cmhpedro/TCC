\abstract{
	Modern software engineering faces a "Paradox of Software Architecture Decision-Making," where the industry strives for decentralized team autonomy but relies on architectural methods dependent on the tacit knowledge of experienced practitioners. While the ArchHypo framework addresses this by treating architectural decisions as testable hypotheses to manage uncertainty, its manual application creates a high cognitive load that hinders adoption. This work presents HypoStage, an open-source plugin for the Backstage Internal Developer Portal designed to operationalize the ArchHypo framework. By providing digital structures for uncertainty assessment, impact analysis, and technical planning, the tool creates the necessary scaffolding to lessen reliance on senior architects. The application of HypoStage to a start-up case study demonstrates its ability to facilitate decentralized, evidence-based architectural decision-making.
