\abstract{
	This capstone project addresses the operational gap in modern software architecture, where rapid evolution often lacks methodological support for decentralized decision-making. While industry trends favor autonomous teams, architectural choices often remain dependent on the tacit knowledge of experienced practitioners. To resolve this, the work builds upon the ArchHypo framework, which treats software architecture as a set of testable hypotheses to manage impact and uncertainty.

	Despite its theoretical benefits, ArchHypo's manual application imposes a high
	cognitive load and significant adoption barriers for development teams. This
	project introduces HypoStage, an open-source plugin for the Backstage Internal
	Developer Portal (IDP), designed to operationalize hypothesis engineering.
	HypoStage integrates directly into the developer's workflow, providing
	structured digital tools for uncertainty assessment, quality attribute
	tracking, and technical planning. The practical utility of the tool is
	demonstrated through a case study involving a web testing start-up,
	illustrating how it supports the full lifecycle of architectural elicitation,
	assessment, and validation. Ultimately, HypoStage provides the technological
	scaffolding necessary to bridge the gap between architectural theory and the
	reality of continuous delivery. }
